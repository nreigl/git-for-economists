# Intro 

- Outreach: 
  - We all have some skills we can share 
- Not related to Eesti Pank/ Taltech
- Short & simple
  - There are much better *technical* tutorials
- Concepts
- Live-tutorial
- Hands on? 

# What is git? 

Git is officially defined as a *distributed version control system* (VCS)

- A system that tracks changes to our project files over time
  - record project changes and go back to specific versions of tracked files, at any given point in time 
  - system can be used by many people to collaborate efficiently
    - each developer can have their own version of the project, distributed on their computer
    - later the individual versions of the project can be merged and adapted to the main version of the project


# Why learn git (as an economist)? 

## A modern economist 

> The master-economist must possess a rare combination of gifts .... He must be mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopherâ€”in some degree....

John Maynard Keynes

Economists today: 

  - Statistical programming 
  - DevTools 
  - Collaborate interdisciplinary

## Economists work with code 

but it seems we are not adopting many important tools from the experts on code

Why? 

 - Learning new things is costly 
 - Tools we are not familiar or aware of
 - Rethink our workflows 
 - Its simply not thought! 

There are other things beside of *Git* economists might want to learn about........-> different tutorial

# GitFlow of Economists

## Version control 

 - Co-authored research is common: Version control allows easier tracking of collaboration and changes
 - Also useful in solo projects
