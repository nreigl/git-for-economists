# What is Git?

Git is officially defined as a *distributed version control system* (VCS)

- A system that tracks changes to our project files over time
- record project changes and go back to specific versions of tracked files, at any given point in time
- system can be used by many people to collaborate efficiently
- each developer can have their own version of the project, distributed on their computer
- later the individual versions of the project can be merged and adapted to the main version of the project

---
# What is GitHub?

- [GitHub](GitHub.com) is an online platform built for collaborative software development that uses the git protocol
- Git and GitHub are distinct things
- GitHub provides free unlimited private repos
- Paid subscriptions for a wide range of services
  - University affiliation can get you more free stuff

Alternatives

- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product)
- Host your private git server

# Why learn git (as an economist)?

> The master-economist must possess a rare combination of gifts .... He must be mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopherâ€”in some degree....

John Maynard Keynes

Economists today:

- Statistical programming
- DevTools
- Collaborate (interdisciplinary) (on open source projects)


---
# Economists work with code

but it seems we are not adopting many important tools from the experts on code

Why?

- Learning new things is costly
- Rethink our workflows
- Its simply not thought!

# Who uses Git?

# Why use version control (VC)?

Do you have files like final.txt, final_revised.txt, final_revised2.txt, final_revised2_revised.txt?

# VC with git

  - Keep track of changes to text files line-by-line over time
  - Keep track of what you changed between different versions
  - Branching and merging: Experiment safely; integrate when done (robustness checks, revisions)
  - Revert any change if needed
  - Back up and distribute copies of files
  - Co-authored research is common: Version control allows easier tracking of collaboration and changes
    - Work offline and asynchronously
    - Collaborate remotely, centralized,  in real time

---
# Reproducability

- Many journals require data & code with submissions
- Proper version control makes reproducing results easier
 - DOI integration, off-the-shelf-licensing
- VC and open sourcing of your code operationalises the idea of open science and reproducability

Not directly VC but good to know
- GitHub offers tools for code testing and code deployment

---
# Teaching

- Using GitHub to teach encourages students to use git and GitHub themselves --> important industry skill
- Allows to update and test new teaching material before
- Easier to upload and distribute new teaching material (when using GitHub)

# Git concepts

- **repository(repo)**: a collection of files and their history
- **commit**: a snapshot of your files at a given time
- **Staging area**: where you list files that will go into your next commit
- **(local) Repository**: where the commits are stored; ie, it contains thef ull history of previous versions of the files in the repository, and relevant metadata
- **(remote) Repository**: a version of the repository hosted elsewhere
- **gitignore**: a file that declares what should **NOT** be tracked
- **Main (or Master)**: Main version of the code
- **Branches**: sequence of commits which can trace *alternative* history and versions of your code in the repo
- **HEAD**: pointer to branch ("Where your next commit would go")

---
# Basic Git commands

- **git init**: start a new repository in the working directory
- **git status**: query the state of your director
- **git add**: add new or modified files to the staging area
- **git commit**: commit changes in the index
- **git branch**: create a branch  or list branches
- **git checkout**: switch within a branch or between branches
- **git diff**: show what changed wrt. the last commit or index
- **git log**: show the commit history
- **git push**: send your local changes to a remote server
- **git pull (git fetch; git merge)**: get last changes from a remote
- **git clone**: create local copy of public source project

---
# Setup

- Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Install and if necessary set path
- Terminal editor
- Various shell addons for various terminals
- Configure your name and & email


```bash
git config --global user.name "Your name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

Tips:
```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait" # sets VS code as core editor
git config --global -e
```

Possible trap:
```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true # Windows
git config --global core.autocrlf input # OSX
```

---
# Collaborate with others:

  - Create GitHub account
  - Star, clone, and fork other projects
  - GitHub Issues are a great way to collaborate (and learn new things)
    - Learn how to create Minimal Working Examples (MWE)

# Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)

- RStudio

A Review of Git Workflow Management https://medium.com/@hengfeng/a-review-of-git-workflow-management-7f9fbebd9370


---
# Basic Workflow

1. Create an empty folder
2. Init repository (**git init**)
3. Add files & annotate them
4. Add the files to the staging area (**git add**)
5. Commit the files (**git commit**)



---
# Personal remote workflow (Option 1)

- Steps 1-5
- Create an *empty* repo on GitHub
- Link the GitHub remote to your local repo
- Push from the local repo to the remote
- After working on the local repo, repeat steps 4-5
- If the working tree is not *clean* before pulling from remote, repeat steps 4-5
- Pull from the remote to the local repo

Pros:
 - Decide when to push to GitHub
 - Language specific project Environments (Julia Environments)

Cons:
 - Not a good workflow for non-empty remotes
 - In case of non language environment -> no README.md, no liscence, no .gitignore

Always pull from the upstream repo *before* you push any changes

---
# Personal remote workflow (Option 2)

- Create a new repo on GitHub
   - Add README.md, .gitignore and liscene. Can also add collaborators
- Clone remote to an emppty, non-VC local directory
- Work on your local repo
- Push from the local to the remote repo

Pros:
 - Creating the repo on GitHub first means that it will always be "upstream" of your (and any other) local copies
  - In effect, this allows GitHub to act as the central node in the distributed VC network
  - Especially valuable when you are collaborating on a project with others

Cons:
 - Not every project goes on GitHub
 - Certain local projects *might* collide with GitHub created repos


 Always pull from the upstream repo *before* you push any changes

---
# Working with remotes tips

- `git fecht, git merge` is better than `git pull` if you suspect merge conflicts
- Do **NOT** `git rebase` public open source repos

# Collaborating workflow

- Fork a public repo
- Clone the *forked* repo to local empty folder
- (*Optional: create a dev branch*)
- Work on the forked repo (*main or dev and then merge back to main*)
- Push back to the personal fork
- Create a pull request
- Review process of pull request
